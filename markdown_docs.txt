<!-- SilkGhost Introduction -->
<h1 id="silk-ghost-introduction">[LOGO:SilkGhost]</h1>

**SilkGhost** is a reverb plugin engineered to help you shape immersive, evocative soundscapes with ease and precision. It's a proprietary creation, built out of a love for smooth, immersive, otherworldly sounds, and a desire to extend that same sound to the world.

With a programmatic approach, SilkGhost offers an unparalleled platform for creating anything from subtle, supportive room tones to immense, atmospheric washes and infinite reverberations. From cinematic sound design and ambient textures to intimate vocal spaces, SilkGhost delivers exceptional realism, musicality, and control at every turn.

<!-- SilkGhost Key Features -->
<h2 id="silk-ghost-key-features">Key Features</h2>

### **Powerful Convolution Engine**

Algorithmically, SilkGhost is different. Instead of being built on a traditional framework-driven convolver, we've re-engineered SilkGhost using a custom convolution engine that is capable of generating authentic, detailed reverbs derived from curated impulse responses, and doing it pretty efficiently too.

### **Dynamic Parameter Control**

At the heart of SilkGhost are the **essential reverb controls**:

- **Decay Time** adjusts the reverb's length,
- **Wet Mix** balances dry and processed signals,
- **Pre-Delay** adds space before reverb onset, and
- **Proximity** shapes the balance between early reflections and late reverb tails.

To **shape the reverb tail**, you can use:

- **High-Pass** and **Low-Pass** filters to fine-tune the tonal balance of your reverbs,
- **Modulation Depth** and **Modulation Rate** to introduce movement to the reverb tail,
- **Post Gain** to ensure optimal output levels,
- **Reverse** to create dramatic pre-swells, giving SilkGhost a unique character and allowing you to create ethereal evolving transitions.

The **Quality Mode** selector allows you to balance fidelity and CPU usage, giving you balance while you're sketching out your ideas, and the ability to crank it up when you're ready to export.

You've also got plenty of presets to get you started, with subtle, supportive room tones to lush, atmospheric washes. Access these in the **Preset** dropdown menu.

<!-- Parameter Reference -->
<h1 id="parameter-reference">Parameter Reference</h1>

This section details each adjustable parameter in SilkGhost. By understanding how each control affects the sound, you can craft reverb environments that perfectly complement your mixes.

### Presets

- **What**: Curated reverb configurations for various styles (e.g., _Large Hall_, _Small Room_).
- **Tip**: Load a preset as a starting point, then tweak parameters for your unique mix.

### Quality Mode

- **Modes**: High, Medium, Low, Garbage
- **Use**: High mode for maximal realism. Reduce quality in large sessions to save CPU without halting creativity.

### Decay Time

- **Description**: Determines how long the reverb lingers.
- **Short Decay**: Tight, controlled ambience for vocals or percussion.
- **Long Decay**: Expansive, cinematic tails for pads and sound design.

### Wet Mix

- **Description**: Balances dry and reverberated signals.
- **Tip**: Keep Wet Mix modest (10-30%) for subtle space, increase for lush, immersive environments.

### Pre-Delay

- **Description**: Delays the onset of reverb, improving clarity.
- **Tip**: A small pre-delay (10-20 ms) ensures the source remains defined before the reverb engulfs the sound.

### High-Pass & Low-Pass Filters

- **Description**: Control frequency content of the reverb tail.
- **High-Pass**: Remove low-end rumble.
- **Low-Pass**: Soften harsh highs, ensuring the reverb sits smoothly in the mix.

### Reverse Reverb

- **Description**: Flips the reverb tail, creating unique pre-swell effects.
- **Use**: Perfect for transitions, cinematic builds, or experimental textures.

### Modulation Depth & Rate

- **Description**: Introduce movement within the reverb tail.
- **Depth**: Amount of modulation.
- **Rate**: Speed of modulation cycles.
- **Tip**: Subtle modulation enhances natural liveliness; higher settings yield creative warbling or shimmering effects.

### Proximity

- **Description**: Adjusts the balance between early reflections and late tails.
- **Near (Higher Values)**: More immediate, present reverb.
- **Far (Lower Values)**: Distant, diffuse ambience.

### Post Gain

- **Description**: Final output level after all processing.
- **Tip**: Adjust post gain to maintain consistent mix levels as you tweak parameters.

### Duck

- **Description**: Automatically attenuates reverb during active dry signals.
- **Use**: Helps vocals and leads remain clear, while reverb fills the gaps in performance.
- **Tip**: 30-50% Ducking often strikes the perfect balance for intelligibility.

### Stretch

- **Description**: Temporally smears the reverb, extending and evolving tails.
- **Use**: Combine with long Decay Times and Modulation for lush ambient pads.
- **Tip**: Even a slight stretch can add character; maxing it out creates ethereal, sustained atmospheres.

### Separate

- **Description**: Controls the stereo image of the reverb.
- **Negative Values**: Wider, enveloping stereo fields.
- **Positive Values**: More centered, focused reverbs.
- **Tip**: Adjust separation to carve out space in busy mixes or emphasize the reverb’s source location.

<!-- Tips & Techniques -->
<h1 id="tips--techniques">Tips & Techniques</h1>

1. **Dial in Proximity & Pre-Delay**: Fine-tune these to maintain clarity while immersing elements in a larger-than-life space.
2. **Utilize Ducking for Vocal Clarity**: Let your reverb bloom in the silence between phrases, keeping vocals intelligible.
3. **Balance Wet Mix and Post Gain**: Adjust after shaping the tail, ensuring the reverb complements rather than competes.
4. **Subtle Modulation for Realism**: Small amounts of Depth/Rate can emulate natural fluctuations in real rooms.

<!-- Troubleshooting & FAQs -->
<h1 id="troubleshooting--faqs">Troubleshooting & FAQs</h1>

**Q: CPU Spikes in High Quality Mode?**  
A: Switch to Medium or Low quality to reduce CPU load without halting your creative flow.

**Q: Reverb Feels Muddy?**  
A: Increase High-Pass frequency or reduce Low-Pass to tighten the tonality.

**Q: Can’t Hear the Ducking?**  
A: Increase Duck percentage or ensure a strong, present dry signal triggers the ducking effect.

**Q: Too Much Stereo Spread?**  
A: Adjust Separate toward center (0% to 100%) for a more focused reverb image.
