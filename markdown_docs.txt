# Tips & Techniques

## Balancing Dry/Wet for Depth

- Start with a low Wet Mix, gradually increase until the sound is enveloped but not drowned.
- Use Duck to maintain clarity during complex passages.

## Utilizing Modulation for Movement

- Subtle Depth (~0.1) and slow Rate (~0.2 Hz) create delicate, shimmering tails.
- For more experimental tracks, increase Depth and Rate to turn your reverb into a living, evolving texture.

## Employing Duck for Mix Clarity

- Vocals and lead instruments benefit from higher Duck settings, ensuring the reverb doesn't mask important transients.
- When the source stops playing, the reverb returns in full bloom, adding depth to the silent spaces.

## Stretching Tails for Ambient Pads

- Combine Stretch (50%-100%) with long Decay (5s or more) to create haunting, atmospheric pads from simple sounds.
- Add Modulation for a constantly shifting sonic landscape.

## Stereo Imaging with Separate

- For dense mixes, pull Separate towards negative values for a wider stereo image, giving instruments room to breathe.
- In sparse arrangements, push Separate towards mono to center the reverb and focus the listener's attention.

# Parameter Reference

## Presets
**What**: Curated configurations of all parameters for different acoustic spaces.
**Use**: Select a preset as a starting point and adjust parameters to taste.

**Examples**:
- Large Hall: Long decays and spacious reflections.
- Small Room: Shorter tails for intimate ambiences.

## Quality Mode
**What**: Adjusts the convolution's detail level and CPU load.
**Options**: High, Medium, Low, Garbage
**Tip**: Start on High for best quality; move down to conserve CPU in large projects.

## Decay Time
**What**: Length of the reverb tail.
**Range**: 0.5s - 10.0s
**Tip**: Short decays for subtle ambience; longer decays for lush, immersive reverbs.

## Wet Mix
**What**: Balance between dry (original) and wet (reverb) signal.
**Range**: 0% - 100%
**Tip**: Keep under 30% for subtle depth, push beyond 50% for more atmospheric washes.

## High-Pass & Low-Pass Filters
**What**: Shape the tonal balance of the reverb.
**Ranges**:
- HPF: 20 Hz - 1,000 Hz
- LPF: 1,000 Hz - 20,000 Hz
**Tip**: High-pass to remove rumble, low-pass to avoid harsh highs.

## Pre-Delay
**What**: Delays the onset of reverb, maintaining clarity on transients.
**Range**: 0 - 200 ms
**Tip**: A short pre-delay (10-20 ms) can add separation between the source and the reverb, enhancing intelligibility.

## Reverse Reverb
**What**: Flips the reverb tail, creating a swell before the original sound.
**Tip**: Perfect for ethereal transitions or dramatic effects, especially on vocals and pads.

## Modulation Depth & Rate
**What**: Adds gentle movement to the reverb tail.
**Depth Range**: 0.0 - 1.0
**Rate Range**: 0.1 Hz - 10 Hz
**Tip**: Low depth and slow rate for a subtle shimmer; higher depths and faster rates for experimental textures.

## Proximity
**What**: Adjusts balance between early reflections and late tails.
**Range**: 0% (Far) - 100% (Near)
**Tip**: Increase proximity for a closer, more intimate feel; reduce to push the sound source back into the reverb field.

## Post Gain
**What**: Controls final output level after all processing.
**Range**: -36 dB to +36 dB
**Tip**: Use to compensate for loud or quiet tails without altering the plugin's internal balance.

## Duck
**What**: Temporarily reduces reverb level when dry signal is present, ensuring clarity and intelligibility.
**Range**: 0% - 100%
**Tip**: High duck settings allow your main elements (vocals, snares, etc.) to cut through, while the reverb blooms in the spaces between.

## Stretch
**What**: Elongates the reverb tail, smearing it over time for pads, drones, and ethereal effects.
**Range**: 0% - 100%
**Tip**: Combine Stretch with long decay times and modulation for rich, evolving soundscapes. Perfect for ambient, cinematic music.

## Separate
**What**: Adjusts stereo imaging of the reverberated signal.
**Range**: -100% (wider) to 100% (more mono)
**Tip**: Keep near 0% for natural width, push negative for expansive stereo fields, or move positive to focus the reverb in the center.

# Creative Applications

## Vocal Enhancement & Clarity
- Use a moderate Decay Time (1.5s-2.5s) and subtle Wet Mix (~20%) to add depth without losing intelligibility.
- Apply Duck so the reverb steps back when the vocalist sings, ensuring every lyric is clear.
- A touch of Pre-Delay (10-20 ms) separates the voice from its own reverb, keeping the performance articulate.

## Drum Rooms & Ambience
- Short Decay Times (0.8s-1.2s) work well to give drums a sense of space.
- High-Pass Filtering around 200 Hz prevents low-end build-up.
- Slight Stretch can add a unique character, prolonging snare tails into a washy, dreamy effect.

## Guitar & Instrument Lushness
- Longer Decay Times (3-5s) can transform guitars into pad-like textures.
- Modulation adds shimmer and swirl, perfect for post-rock or ambient genres.
- Experiment with Separate to set how wide and enveloping the guitar's reverb sits in the mix.

## Cinematic Soundscapes
- Crank up Decay Time and Stretch for endless, evolving tails.
- Use Reverse Reverb for transitions, swell-ups before big hits, or dramatic scene changes.
- Employ Low-Pass to keep the reverb smooth and non-intrusive, and Proximity to push sounds deep into the virtual stage.
