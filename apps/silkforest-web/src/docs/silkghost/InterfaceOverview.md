## Signal Flow & Processing Order

1. **Input Dry Signal**: Enters SilkGhost.
2. **Pre-Delay & Diffusion**: Sets initial reflections and spatial character.
3. **Convolution & Modulation**: Applies the IR-based reverb and introduces movement.
4. **Filtering & Post Gain**: Shapes frequency response and output level.
5. **Ducking, Stretching & Separating**: Adds dynamic, temporal, and stereo imaging enhancements.
6. **Dry/Wet Mix**: Blends processed signal with original input.
