# Parameter Reference

## Presets
**What**: Curated configurations of all parameters for different acoustic spaces.
**Use**: Select a preset as a starting point and adjust parameters to taste.

**Examples**:
- Large Hall: Long decays and spacious reflections.
- Small Room: Shorter tails for intimate ambiences.

## Quality Mode
**What**: Adjusts the convolution's detail level and CPU load.
**Options**: High, Medium, Low, Garbage
**Tip**: Start on High for best quality; move down to conserve CPU in large projects.

## Decay Time
**What**: Length of the reverb tail.
**Range**: 0.5s - 10.0s
**Tip**: Short decays for subtle ambience; longer decays for lush, immersive reverbs.

## Wet Mix
**What**: Balance between dry (original) and wet (reverb) signal.
**Range**: 0% - 100%
**Tip**: Keep under 30% for subtle depth, push beyond 50% for more atmospheric washes.

## High-Pass & Low-Pass Filters
**What**: Shape the tonal balance of the reverb.
**Ranges**:
- HPF: 20 Hz - 1,000 Hz
- LPF: 1,000 Hz - 20,000 Hz
**Tip**: High-pass to remove rumble, low-pass to avoid harsh highs.

## Pre-Delay
**What**: Delays the onset of reverb, maintaining clarity on transients.
**Range**: 0 - 200 ms
**Tip**: A short pre-delay (10-20 ms) can add separation between the source and the reverb, enhancing intelligibility.

## Reverse Reverb
**What**: Flips the reverb tail, creating a swell before the original sound.
**Tip**: Perfect for ethereal transitions or dramatic effects, especially on vocals and pads.

## Modulation Depth & Rate
**What**: Adds gentle movement to the reverb tail.
**Depth Range**: 0.0 - 1.0
**Rate Range**: 0.1 Hz - 10 Hz
**Tip**: Low depth and slow rate for a subtle shimmer; higher depths and faster rates for experimental textures.

## Proximity
**What**: Adjusts balance between early reflections and late tails.
**Range**: 0% (Far) - 100% (Near)
**Tip**: Increase proximity for a closer, more intimate feel; reduce to push the sound source back into the reverb field.

## Post Gain
**What**: Controls final output level after all processing.
**Range**: -36 dB to +36 dB
**Tip**: Use to compensate for loud or quiet tails without altering the plugin's internal balance.

## Duck
**What**: Temporarily reduces reverb level when dry signal is present, ensuring clarity and intelligibility.
**Range**: 0% - 100%
**Tip**: High duck settings allow your main elements (vocals, snares, etc.) to cut through, while the reverb blooms in the spaces between.

## Stretch
**What**: Elongates the reverb tail, smearing it over time for pads, drones, and ethereal effects.
**Range**: 0% - 100%
**Tip**: Combine Stretch with long decay times and modulation for rich, evolving soundscapes. Perfect for ambient, cinematic music.

## Separate
**What**: Adjusts stereo imaging of the reverberated signal.
**Range**: -100% (wider) to 100% (more mono)
**Tip**: Keep near 0% for natural width, push negative for expansive stereo fields, or move positive to focus the reverb in the center.
