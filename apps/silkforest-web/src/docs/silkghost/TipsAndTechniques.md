# Tips & Techniques

## Balancing Dry/Wet for Depth

- Start with a low Wet Mix, gradually increase until the sound is enveloped but not drowned.
- Use Duck to maintain clarity during complex passages.

## Utilizing Modulation for Movement

- Subtle Depth (~0.1) and slow Rate (~0.2 Hz) create delicate, shimmering tails.
- For more experimental tracks, increase Depth and Rate to turn your reverb into a living, evolving texture.

## Employing Duck for Mix Clarity

- Vocals and lead instruments benefit from higher Duck settings, ensuring the reverb doesn't mask important transients.
- When the source stops playing, the reverb returns in full bloom, adding depth to the silent spaces.

## Stretching Tails for Ambient Pads

- Combine Stretch (50%-100%) with long Decay (5s or more) to create haunting, atmospheric pads from simple sounds.
- Add Modulation for a constantly shifting sonic landscape.

## Stereo Imaging with Separate

- For dense mixes, pull Separate towards negative values for a wider stereo image, giving instruments room to breathe.
- In sparse arrangements, push Separate towards mono to center the reverb and focus the listener's attention.
