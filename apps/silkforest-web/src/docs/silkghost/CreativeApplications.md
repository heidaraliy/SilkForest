# Creative Applications

## Vocal Enhancement & Clarity
- Use a moderate Decay Time (1.5s-2.5s) and subtle Wet Mix (~20%) to add depth without losing intelligibility.
- Apply Duck so the reverb steps back when the vocalist sings, ensuring every lyric is clear.
- A touch of Pre-Delay (10-20 ms) separates the voice from its own reverb, keeping the performance articulate.

## Drum Rooms & Ambience
- Short Decay Times (0.8s-1.2s) work well to give drums a sense of space.
- High-Pass Filtering around 200 Hz prevents low-end build-up.
- Slight Stretch can add a unique character, prolonging snare tails into a washy, dreamy effect.

## Guitar & Instrument Lushness
- Longer Decay Times (3-5s) can transform guitars into pad-like textures.
- Modulation adds shimmer and swirl, perfect for post-rock or ambient genres.
- Experiment with Separate to set how wide and enveloping the guitar's reverb sits in the mix.

## Cinematic Soundscapes
- Crank up Decay Time and Stretch for endless, evolving tails.
- Use Reverse Reverb for transitions, swell-ups before big hits, or dramatic scene changes.
- Employ Low-Pass to keep the reverb smooth and non-intrusive, and Proximity to push sounds deep into the virtual stage.
